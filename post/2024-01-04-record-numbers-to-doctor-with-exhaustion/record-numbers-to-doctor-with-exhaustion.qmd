The case summarized:

- There has been a dramatic increase in the number of patients seeking medical attention for exhaustion during the pandemic.
- The increase has occurred in all age groups, with the exception of children aged 0–4 years.
- FHI statistician Richard Aubrey White and other researchers are concerned about the development.
- The increase in exhaustion came simultaneously with the omicron variant, and there is a temporal connection between infection waves and increases in exhaustion.
- Several large studies show that COVID-19 can cause serious long-term consequences.
- Researcher and infectious disease physician Arne Søraas urges Norwegian public health authorities to update themselves on international research in the field.
- Professional director Preben Aavitsland at FHI believes there is not enough good knowledge to establish that COVID-19 leads to serious long-term consequences.
